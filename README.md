# proposetoyourcrush - Will You Be My Girlfriend?

Welcome to the most charming corner of my coding journey! This whimsical website is my first foray into JavaScript and a testament to my adventurous learning curve. It's not just code; it's a quirky proposal machine!

## What's This?

This is a fun, interactive website where I've tried to wear my heart on my digital sleeve. It's designed to pop the question to my crush in a way that's hard to decline (literally). Using the power of JavaScript, the 'No' button runs away from your cursor, so you can only answer 'Yes'. Go ahead and try to say 'No', I dare you!

## Why This Project?

I wanted to combine my passion for coding with a dash of humor. This project allowed me to learn and implement basic JavaScript concepts like event listeners and DOM manipulation, all while aiming for a smile.

## How It Works

- Open the website, and you're greeted with a simple yet bold proposal: "HI CRUSH, I like you a lot, wanna go on a date?"
- You are presented with two buttons: "Yes" and "No".
- Try to click "No", and watch the cursor-chasing shenanigans begin.
- Spoiler: You can't actually click "No". (But hey, in matters of the heart, sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith, right?)

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Lessons Learned

This project was my introduction to JavaScript, and through it, I learned about:

- Basic syntax and operations in JavaScript
- The Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it
- Responding to user events like mouse movements or clicks
- Basic web development practices and deployment

## Acknowledgements

- Heartfelt thanks to my friends who were subjected to multiple "proposals" during the testing phase.
